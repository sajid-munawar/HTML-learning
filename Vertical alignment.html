            Rather than putting a dictionary inside a list, it’s sometimes useful to put
    a list inside a dictionary. For example, consider how you might describe a

    really store is a list of the pizza’s toppings. With a dictionary, a list of toppings
    can be just one aspect of the pizza you’re describing.
