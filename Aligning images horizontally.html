        Rather than putting a dictionary inside a list, it’s sometimes useful to put
a list inside a dictionary. For example, consider how you might describe a
pizza that someone is ordering. If you were to use only a list, all you could
really store is a list of the pizza’s toppings. With a dictionary, a list of toppings
can be just one aspect of the pizza you’re describing.
